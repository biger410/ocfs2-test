The lock_grab test uses the ocfs2 dlmfs to take and release cluster
locks.  It works by a simple algoritm.

First, it defines a lock space.  This space is merely a number of locks
(the -c option, defaults to 100).  It then goes into a loop.  In each
pass it does the following:

1) choose whether to deal with PR or EX locks this pass

If it is dealing with PR locks this pass, it does the following:

2) choose whether to do an acquire or release
3) choose what lock(s) to act on
4) acquire or release the chosen PR locks

If it is dealing with EX locks, it does this instead:

2) choose an unlocked lock to act on
3) lock that lock with an EX
4) sleep a random amount of time
5) unlock the lock

The idea here is that nodes grabbing PR locks will wait on a sleeping EX
lock, and nodes trying to get an EX lock will sleep on held PR locks.
Thus, contention.
